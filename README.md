# Webhooks plugin for [@codex_bot](https://ifmo.su/bot) platform

Allows you to send custom messages to Slack or Telegram chat.

## Getting started

Add [@codex_bot](https://t.me/codex_bot) to your chat.

Enter a command `/notify_start` to get a link for current chat.

## Usage

Send a `POST` request to the given url with `message` param.

Set a parse mode if you need to show bold, italic, fixed-width text or inline URLs in the message.

| Field        | Type   | Description                     |
|--------------|--------|---------------------------------|
| `message`    | String | Message text Â                   |
| `parse_mode` | String | (optional) `HTML` or `Markdown` |

## Example

To see how it works, run the following command in terminal.
```
curl -X POST https://notify.bot.ifmo.su/u/ABCD1234 -d "message=Hello world"
```

You'll get message "Hello world" in telegram chat.
